# League Esports Tracker

A single-file, offline-capable dashboard tracking LoL esports (LEC, LCK, LPL, LCS) —
schedules, live games, standings, power rankings, honours, playoff bracket predictor.
Deployed via GitHub Pages straight from this repo.

## Ground rules

- **Single file.** Everything — markup, CSS, JS — lives in `index.html`. No build step,
  no bundler, no package.json. Edit it directly.
- **File must stay named `index.html`** — GitHub Pages serves that filename specifically;
  renaming it breaks the deployed site.
- **Never rename the `nexusdesk_` localStorage prefix** (see `LS()` helper near the top
  of the `<script>` block) or any existing element IDs. The app was rebranded from
  NexusDesk to League Esports Tracker, but saved state (sim brackets, caches, settings)
  in users' browsers still depends on the old key prefix — renaming it silently wipes
  everyone's saved state.
- **Verify every edit** by extracting the inline `<script>` and syntax-checking it:
  ```
  node -e "fs=require('fs');fs.writeFileSync('_check.js', fs.readFileSync('index.html','utf8').match(/<script>([\s\S]*?)<\/script>/)[1])" && node --check _check.js && rm _check.js
  ```
- **Palette is lolesports.com's**, not the old hextech gold theme: pure-black canvas
  (`--bg:#000000`), near-black panels, white type, cyan (`--cyan:#0BC6E3`) as the sole
  accent for live state / league identity, red for live/loss, green for win. Region
  colours: LEC teal, LCK silver, LPL red, LCS blue (see `:root` CSS vars). Keep new UI
  consistent with this — don't reintroduce gold.
- Fonts: Barlow Condensed (display), IBM Plex Mono (mono/labels), Inter (body).

## Data model

- **Live data** (schedules, live games, standings, team logos) comes from the unofficial
  lolesports public API (`API` / `API_KEY` constants near the top of the script) at
  runtime. This needs no manual maintenance.
- **Baked-in constants** go stale and need periodic research + patching:
  - `REGIONS` — per-region split label, regular-season game count, default playoff
    format, channel/wiki links
  - `HONOURS` — season honours board (tournament winners, runners-up, dates)
  - `STORYLINES` — home-tab narrative bullets
  - `POWER_RANKINGS` + `POWER_RANKINGS_ASOF` — mirror of lolesports.com Global Power
    Rankings
  - `FORMATS` — playoff bracket wirings (double/single elim graphs)
- When patching baked-in data: research via web search / Leaguepedia (`lol.fandom.com`)
  / Liquipedia (`liquipedia.net`), never invent scores/points/formats — if a value can't
  be verified, leave it and say so. Make targeted string replacements, not rewrites.

## Workflow

Typical session: research current LoL esports state → patch the relevant constant(s) →
`node --check` the script → commit → push. GitHub Pages rebuilds automatically in
~1 minute.
